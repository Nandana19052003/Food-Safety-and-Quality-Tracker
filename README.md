# Food-Safety-and-Quality-Tracker
This is a simple web-based tool for checking the safety of food based on its expiration date and storage conditions.

# Getting Started
To use the food safety checker, simply navigate to the webpage and fill out the form with information about the food you want to check. The form includes fields for the food name, expiration date, storage location, any special storage instructions, and any additional notes or comments.

Once you have filled out the form, click the "Check Food Safety" button to run the checker. The tool will analyze the information you have provided and let you know whether the food is safe to eat or not.

# How It Works
The food safety checker works by checking the expiration date and storage location of the food to determine whether it has been stored properly. If the food is past its expiration date or has been stored improperly, the tool will flag it as potentially unsafe to eat.
